# Basic queries - Joining, grouping and countingðŸ¦†âš½

The EPL data is now ready for analysis. We will start with some simple queries to familiarise ourselves with the data. We will be working in schema _main_ where we have two tables and a one view. Tables: _matches_ and _clubs_. View: _vw_ltables_. 

Basic SQL knowledge is assumed here meaning that you already know what SELECT, FROM, WHERE, JOIN and GROUP BY mean. I will start this and subsequent posts with a series of questions and then provide my solutions. There are often many ways to accomplish th same tasks in SQL, your solutions might very well be better than mine! I would also encourage you to try out your own queries and read relevant [DuckDB documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/) which is excellent.

## Questions

1. One club was undefeated throughout an entire season. Which club achieved this feat and in which season?

2. In one season, two clubs were tied on points and the league was decided on goal difference. What season was that and what two clubs were tied on points?

3. Which club got the highest ever points total? 

4. Which club won the EPL with the lowest points total?

5. Which club ended an EPL season with the lowest total of points for all 32 seasons in the dataset?

6. How many matches were played in each season in our dataset? Order the output from earliest to latest season. Your output should contain 32 rows.

7. How many clubs have participated in each season? Order the output from earliest to latest season.

9. Generate a list of all clubs (club names) that have played in every season in our dataset?

9. List all the clubs (club name) which have won the EPL at least once.

10. Continuing from question 4, how many times have each of those clubs clubs won the EPL and which club has won the most?


## My solutions


1. __Solution__

```sql
SELECT
  season,
  (SELECT club_name 
   FROM clubs 
   WHERE ccode = club_code) club_name
FROM
  vw_ltables
WHERE lost = 0;
```

Yes indeed, it was Arsenal in 2003-2004, the famous _invincibles_ who did not lose a single league game that season. This is a rare event in any major European league. Interestingly though, Arsenal's total of 90 points that season has been bettered multiple times. Check the data yourself to see the clubs who have accrued more than 90 points in a season!

2. __Solution__

```sql
WITH winners AS(
SELECT
  season,
  ccode winner,
  points
FROM
  vw_ltables
WHERE league_position = 1),
runners_up AS(
SELECT
  season,
  ccode runner_up,
  points
FROM
  vw_ltables
WHERE league_position = 2)
SELECT
  winners.season,
  winner,
  runner_up
FROM winners
  JOIN runners_up 
    ON winners.points = runners_up.points
    AND winners.season = runners_up.season;
```

Season 2011_2012  was decided on the last day when Sergio AgÃ¼ero scored a dramatic goal for Manchester City in injury time to seal the victory they needed to snatch the title from their Manchester United neighbours and rivals on goal difference, both clubs having finished on 89 points. An unforgettable climax to the season!

3. __Solution__

```sql
SELECT
  season,
  ccode,
  points
FROM vw_ltables
WHERE league_position = 1
  AND points = (SELECT MAX(points) FROM vw_ltables)
ORDER BY league_position;
```
Only one club has ever attained 100 points in a single EPL season; it was the famous Manchester City "centurians". A phenomenal feat getting 100 out of a possible 114 points in a single season. How many games did they lose that season?

4. __Solution__

```sql
SELECT
  season,
  ccode,
  points
FROM vw_ltables
WHERE league_position = 1
  AND points = (SELECT MIN(points) 
                FROM vw_ltables 
                WHERE league_position = 1)
ORDER BY league_position;
```
This was Manchester United, season 1996-1997. Many clubs accrued much higher points totals than this over the seasons but did __not__ win the league, check the data to identify them.

5. __Solution__

```sql
SELECT
  season,
  ccode,
  points
FROM vw_ltables
WHERE points = (SELECT MIN(points) FROM vw_ltables);
```

It was poor Derby County with a paltry 11 points in season 2007-2008. We will look at how to identify which clubs were relegated for a given season in an upcoming post.


6. __Solution__

The _matches_ table has the data we need and the wording of the question suggests a COUNT() of matches and a GROUP BY on season.

```sql
SELECT
  season,
  COUNT(mid) season_match_count
FROM matches
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY CAST(STRING_SPLIT(season, '_')[1] AS INTEGER);
```

The ORDER BY sorts on the extracted four digit first year of each season. I used this trick in the previous post in creation of the view _vw_ltables_. The first three season had 462 matches per season, for all subsequent ones it was 380. The answer to the next question provides us with an explanation for the discrepancy.

7. __Solution__

Once again the question wording suggests a COUNT() and a GROUP BY on season. The data we need can be derived from either the _matches_ table or the _vw_ltables_ view. If we use the _matches_, we need to first perform a DISTINCT on season and club code using either the _hcg_ or _acc_ columns. We use table _matches_ will do the DISTINCT part in a CTE.

```sql
WITH uniq_season_club AS(
  SELECT DISTINCT
    season,
    hcc
FROM matches)
SELECT
  season,
  COUNT(hcc) season_club_count
FROM uniq_season_club
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY CAST(STRING_SPLIT(season, '_')[1] AS INTEGER);
```

There were 22 clubs represented in the first three season but this number was reduced to 20 in subsequent seasons.

8. __Solution__

Since we need a list of club names, this suggests we need to join to the clubs table with a COUNT() of seasons and a GROUP BY on club. We know we have 32 season worth of data so we need to know how many clubs have played in each of these seasons. The HAVING clause is the one to use when you want to filter rows returned by GROUP BY. We can use the same CTE as in the previous solution but this time we have to switch around the COUNT and GROUP BY columns in the query of our CTE.

```sql
WITH uniq_season_club AS(
SELECT DISTINCT
  season,
  c.club_name
FROM matches
JOIN clubs c
    ON matches.hcc = c.club_code)
SELECT
  club_name,
  COUNT(season) season_count
FROM uniq_season_club
GROUP BY club_name
HAVING COUNT(season) = 32;
```

This generates the following output:

|     club_name     | season_count |
|-------------------|-------------:|
| Liverpool         | 32           |
| Manchester United | 32           |
| Tottenham Hotspur | 32           |
| Everton           | 32           |
| Arsenal           | 32           |
| Chelsea           | 32           |

Surprisingly only six clubs have been represented in all 32 seasons.

9. __Solution__

This is an easy one; we only need to query _vs_ltables_ and filter on _league_position_ equals 1. The DISTICT qualifier removes duplicates 

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  c.club_name 
FROM vw_ltables vlt
  JOIN clubs c ON vlt.ccode = c.club_code
WHERE league_position = 1;
```
This produces the following output:

|     club_name     |
|-------------------|
| Blackburn Rovers  |
| Arsenal           |
| Leicester City    |
| Chelsea           |
| Liverpool         |
| Manchester City   |
| Manchester United |

Only seven clubs have won the EPL over these 32 seasons.

10. __Solution__

Once again we are counting, grouping and joining to replace club code with club name.

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT club_name 
   FROM clubs 
   WHERE ccode = club_code) club_name,
  COUNT(season) league_titles
FROM  vw_ltables vlt
WHERE league_position = 1
GROUP BY ccode
ORDER BY league_titles DESC;
```

Our output:

|     club_name     | league_titles |
|-------------------|--------------:|
| Manchester United | 13            |
| Manchester City   | 8             |
| Chelsea           | 5             |
| Arsenal           | 3             |
| Blackburn Rovers  | 1             |
| Liverpool         | 1             |
| Leicester City    | 1             |



We have used a __subquery__ in the main SELECT to do the lookup of club name using club code. When used like this, the subquery can only return a single value, that it, it must be _scalar_. Our ORDER BY  DESC clause highlights Manchester United as the most successful club of the EPL era winning 13 titles, five more than their city neighbours, Manchester City.

## Wrapping up

These 10 questions gave us a chance to explore the data and answer some interesting questions. DuckDB is an excellent tool for this type of analysis due to its comprehensive support for modern SQL features.

## Up next

We will use SQL to identify which clubs were relegated/promoted for each season. We will also look at how clubs have fared over the season against their greatest rivals. Arsenal-Tottenham and Liverpool-Manchester United are two such rivalries that we will investigate.
